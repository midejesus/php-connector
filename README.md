# Payment Connector

## Disclaimer

This project implements the [VTEX Payment Provider Protocol](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/payment-provider-protocol) using the PHP language.

For the moment, the Credit Card payment flow and a redirect flow are defined.

The goal of the project is to verify that the [documentation](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/reference/payment-flow) is providing clear information and to create code examples for the partners to use.

The [Test Suite](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/payment-provider-protocol#3-payment-provider-homologation) is being used to verify the endpoints, and
for the moment, the **Authorize**, **Denied**, **Cancel**, **AsyncApproved** and **AsyncDenied** tests are passing.

## How to use the project

You can clone the project and serve it locally with the PHP built-in web server by running the following command on the project folder:

`php -S localhost:8000 index.php`

and to test locally, you can use your favorite API client such as Insomnia or Postman.

If you want to test it with the Test Suite, then you should set up the project in a serve so that if follows the [endpoint requirements](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/reference/payment-provider-protocol-api-overview#endpoint-requirements):

- Must use a standard subdomain/domain name, and not a IP address.
- Must be served over HTTPS on port 443 with TLS 1.2 support.
- Must respond in less than 5 seconds when running the tests.
- Must respond in less than 20 seconds when in production.

For that I used Heroku, as the setup was almost out-of-the-box.

## Redirect Flow

The Redirect purchase flow is used when customers confirm the payment option in the store and are then redirected to a different page to fill in payment information and complete the purchase.

In our example, we set up a simple form in which the customer can select a custom number of installments for the payment. The installments options are dynamic, based on the payment amount.

Dynamic installments is not a feature available in the SmartCheckout template, so it needs to be done externally, redirecting the customer to a different page in order to get extra information before authorizing the purchase payment.

To implement this flow, we created a new payment method called "myRedirectPaymentMethod". The initial authorization response for this method sends the status "undefined" along with a `paymentUrl`.

This paymentUrl should reference the payment somehow, here we went simply with setting the query string `paymentId= {{paymentId}}`.

The gateway will call this paymentUrl, and after the interaction is finished in this page, we should redirect the customer to the `returnUrl`, back to the checkout.

The gateway also expects to receive the final authorization response on the `callbackUrl`.

### Create payment response for redirect method
```json
{
	"paymentId": "5291d5e5-5d0d-4f5c-9677-034138956a08",
	"status": "undefined",
	"tid": "8c8a742d691b571fe639",
	"paymentUrl": "http://php-connector.herokuapp.com/installments.php?paymentId=5291d5e5-5d0d-4f5c-9677-034138956a08"
}
```

## Custom Auto Capture Feature

By setting the interval for `autoSettleDelay`, along with the option `useAutoSettleOptions` to be set on the connector configuration (in the publication process), we allow the merchants to configure different behaviors for the Payment Capture. If the option "Scheduled" is chosen, a value between 0 and 360 (as limited by our manifest) can be set for the capture. This field has precedence over the delayToAutoSettle value sent on the authorization response.
